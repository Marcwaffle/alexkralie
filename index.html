            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="dropcap">A</span>lex is fiercely driven and obsessively dedicated to his creative projects, especially his film. He is secretive, controlling, and often manipulative, putting his goals above the well-being of others. Despite his cold exterior, glimpses of vulnerability and desperation show a deeper internal struggle, intensified by the horrors he faces.

            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>
                Alex began as an ambitious film student, eager to create something meaningful with his friends. But after beginning production on "Marble Hornets," he became increasingly paranoid and withdrawn, haunted by inexplicable occurrences and the ever-present Operator. His obsession with recording everything—perhaps to prove his sanity, perhaps to uncover the truth—led to the breakdown of his friendships and his own mental stability. As the mysterious phenomena escalated, Alex’s choices became more desperate and morally ambiguous, leaving a trail of broken trust and unanswered questions that echo throughout the series.

                    The camera's red light blinked in the dimly lit room, illuminating Alex's tense expression as he glanced nervously toward the window. Every shadow seemed to flicker with possibility, every creak in the floorboards sent his heart racing. He clutched the camera tighter, willing himself to stay focused — there had to be a reason for the strange occurrences, a pattern he could find if only he looked hard enough. “If you’re out there, I’m not afraid of you,” he lied, voice trembling just enough to betray his fear. He scanned the footage from earlier, eyes darting between frames, searching for that telltale distortion that haunted his every waking moment. As the night wore on, exhaustion tugged at his eyelids, but he refused to sleep. If he slept, he might miss something. And in his world, missing something could mean the difference between survival and vanishing without a trace.
