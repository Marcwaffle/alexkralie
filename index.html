            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>
                Alex Kralie was a film student who began work on a student project titled "Marble Hornets" with a group of friends and classmates. Over time, he became increasingly paranoid and secretive, especially after experiencing unsettling phenomena and sightings of the Operator, a mysterious and supernatural entity. Alex's obsession with filming and documenting strange events led to the breakdown of his relationships and growing distrust among the crew. His choices, often made in desperation or fear, set off a chain of events that would haunt him and those involved for years.

            <h2>RP Sample</h2>
            <p>
                The camera’s red light blinked in the dimly lit room, illuminating Alex’s tense expression as he glanced nervously toward the window. Every shadow seemed to flicker with possibility, every creak in the floorboards sent his heart racing. He clutched the camera tighter, willing himself to stay focused — there had to be a reason for the strange occurrences, a pattern he could find if only he looked hard enough. “If you’re out there, I’m not afraid of you,” he lied, voice trembling just enough to betray his fear. He scanned the footage from earlier, eyes darting between frames, searching for that telltale distortion that haunted his every waking moment. As the night wore on, exhaustion tugged at his eyelids, but he refused to sleep. If he slept, he might miss something. And in his world, missing something could mean the difference between survival and vanishing without a trace.
